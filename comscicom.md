Give visual content a description. Include technical explanation that would allow anyone in our course to understand the concept being visualized.

Include mathematical details with inline $\LaTeX$.

You should link out to external resources. However, those should be supplementary, your submission should try to summarize the important aspects so that your submission is as self-contained as reasonable.

## Indirect Submissions

You may also submit an **annotated** list to one or more external communication items. 

The annotation should be a short, one sentence, explanation of the submission.

Some examples:
- link to our Course Forum with submission as post
- link to GitHub project with submission in README.md
- link to GitHub PR on course lecture notes with fleshed out notes
- link to large multimedia, e.g. any audio/video based submissions
- link to Twitter thread on personal twitter account
- link to blog post hosted on personal blog
- link to something I can't think of

## Assessment

Due to the diverse and self-driven nature of these submissions the assessment is qualitative.

Successful submissions will demonstrate visually, mathematically, or verbally one or more technical concepts from or related to our course material. Clear communication demonstrates attention to the details relevant to the chosen medium and explanation simplified so that anyone familiar with our course concepts can appreciate.
