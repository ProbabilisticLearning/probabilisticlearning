## TL;DR: Short Abstract

Write one or two sentences describing your main idea, approach and deliverable.

## Extended Abstract

Write one or two pages describing your proposed project in more detail.

### Summary of Technical Aspect

Describe in a two or three paragraphs, with some equations, the main technical ideas for your project.
If you propose a new model, or an application of existing models, summarize your approach.
If it is unclear, please emphasize the relevance to our course Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning.

### Project Deliverable Goals

Describe concrete results and artifacts that your group will consider a successful project to deliver within the constraints of the semester.
Describe concretely what experiments you plan to run, what results you plan to collect, and how you plan to communicate those results.

### Nice-to-haves

If you have additional ideas, or ambitious goals that would be unlikely to achieve within the project timeline you can describe them here.

If your initial results are extremely promising and you have additional energy you can include these.

If your initial results are less promising you can use these alternative directions, possible experiments, animation ideas and plots to continue or understand.

**Note on Assessment:** Your group will not be graded on whether your results are "good". It is likely you will have a successful project even if you have not successfully implemented your described nice-to-haves, or even project deliverable goals.

### Review of related work

Describe 3 related resources to your proposed project.

Ideally at least 1 resource will be a textbook chapter or review article giving introduction and context to the primary technical aspects of your project.

If you propose any applications involving non-standard data, please include a resource describing similar projects. 
This is primarily that your considering any application that has data appropriately available to allow your attention to be primarily on aspects relevant to our course.

If you are using this project as an opportunity to investigate these methods on your primary research interest, include a resource that describes any connections or attempts at this application.
